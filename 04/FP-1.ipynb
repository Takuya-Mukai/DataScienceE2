    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- The purpose of this Final Project is to **predict the median house value in California districts based on various demographic and housing features**.\n",
    "- The key **dependent variable** (DV) is `median_house_value`, which represents the median value of houses in each district.\n",
    "- Key **independent variables** (IVs) include:\n",
    "    - `longitude` — geographical longitude of the district\n",
    "    - `latitude` — geographical latitude of the district\n",
    "    - `housing_median_age` — median age of houses in the district\n",
    "    - `total_rooms` — total number of rooms in the district\n",
    "    - `total_bedrooms` — total number of bedrooms in the district\n",
    "    - `population` — total population of the district\n",
    "    - `households` — total number of households in the district\n",
    "    - `median_income` — median income of households in the district\n",
    "    - `ocean_proximity` — categorical variable indicating distance to the ocean\n",
    "- This dataset contains 20640 cases. Each client has values for all IVs as well as the DV."
