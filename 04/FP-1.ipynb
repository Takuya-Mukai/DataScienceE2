    "- The purpose of this Final Project is to determine the factors that contribute to a client subscribing to a term deposit.\n",
    "- The key **dependent variable** (DV) is `y`, a binary \"yes\" or \"no\" indicating if the client subscribed.\n",
    "- Key **independent variables** (IVs) include:\n",
    "    - `age`\n",
    "    - `job`\n",
